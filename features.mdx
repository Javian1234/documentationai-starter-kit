## Document Organization and Structure

Organize your documentation into a clear hierarchy using folders and pages. You define navigation menus and sidebars directly in your project settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder">
    In your project root, add folders like `guides/` and `api/`.

    ```
    mkdir docs/guides
    mkdir docs/api
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file">
    Create MDX files in each folder.

    ```
    touch docs/guides/quickstart.mdx
    touch docs/api/endpoints.mdx
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Navigation" icon="menu">
    Edit `nav.yaml` to set your structure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This setup generates automatic table of contents and breadcrumbs.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use YAML frontmatter in each `.mdx` file to set titles and descriptions for better SEO.

## Search and Indexing Functions

Fixit Jamaica indexes all your content automatically. You search by keywords, with fuzzy matching and snippets.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Configuration" default-open="false">
  Customize in `config.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  search:
    providers: ["algolia", "internal"]
    minLength: 3
  ```

  This enables hybrid search across your docs.
</Expandable>

Results highlight matches and show page previews for quick navigation.

## Version Control Basics

Integrate with Git for full version history. You commit changes, branch for features, and deploy previews.

graph TD
    A[Local Changes] --> B[git add .]
    B --> C[git commit -m "Update docs"]
    C --> D[git push origin main]
    D --> E[Deploy Preview]
```

<CodeGroup tabs="Git CLI,GitHub">
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial docs"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-repo/fixit-jamaica-docs.git
git push -u origin main
```
```bash
# On GitHub: Create PR from feature branch
gh pr create --title "Add search feature" --body "Implements advanced indexing"
```
</CodeGroup>
